    <h1>Skills Check 2</h1>
      <p> A little bit about myself, Ashley Vick. I was born in Idaho Falls 33 years ago. I had a very happy childhood despite the fact I had a very abusive sister who would torment me in every way. I found myself escaping everyday to an imaginary reality I had created to get away from the hell that was my reality. It helped me have a very wonderful childhood, but as I grew up and realized that quicksand, lava, pirates, fairies, mermaids, butterflies and prince-charmings WEREN’T actually part of every day life – I became more cynical as an adult. I still believe in fairies and mermaids and nothing can take that away from me.  I spent most of my early twenties searching for “the one.” Being 26 years old, Mormon, living in Utah and single made me, in all intents and purposes, an old-maid and way passed my expiration date. Finally I stopped looking for the one and decided to be complete within myself without looking for anyone to complete me. It was only a year later, when I decided I never wanted to get married and instead had seriously booked a trip to the UK to stalk Benedict Cumberbatch for a time, that my life took u-turn and I ended up accidentally falling in love with the “lawn-boy.” Haha </p>
         <p> Jefferson was a student of my dads’ in high school and took care of our yard after we moved into his neighborhood 11 years ago. I was 6 years his senior and to say I was interested in him could not be farther from the truth (let alone illegal at the time).  Around the same time he got back from his mission in Central Mexico, I had moved back home after, yet another unsuccessful attempt to move out (girls are seriously the worst roommates ever!)  I didn’t really have any friends since I was ‘old’ and all my friends were married and practically had teenagers by then. I asked Jefferson if he wanted to hang out sometime. Like I said, we accidentally fell completely, totally, head-over-heels in love! Everything I ever imagined what love and romance would be like for me was just dumb compared to my relationship with Jefferson. Being a person who doesn’t always live in reality – I had conjured up ridiculous images of romance in my mind throughout the years. Edward from Twilight.  Gilbert Blithe from Anne of Green Gables. Mr. Darcy. Peeta Mallark. You name it… Nothing could be farther from my relationship with Jefferson. I truly feel that no one has every loved anyone as much as I love my husband. He has NO flaws in his character or personality which is REALLY annoying at times. He’s perfect in every way. In the 6 years we’ve been together, I have become “Mama” to two AMAZING boys that are just as glorious as their father. </p>
     <p> Jefferson and I want so many things in our life together. So many things. Mainly to help others who can’t help themselves. We want to have a lot so we can give it away. We didn’t know how to obtain the monetary things we dreamt of until I found out about “Coding.” Our 15 year plan became our 10 year plan. Now it’s become our 5 year plan. I am SO excited to not only learn this skill, but for Jefferson to start and learn Web Development as soon as I’m done.  I truly hope and pray every day that I can be good at this so we can have the life we want. 
    </p>
